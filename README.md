About Project : In recent years, social networks have attracted many users’ interests. People express
their daily experiences and emotions through social networks and become aware of others interests
and thoughts. In these networks, influential users play an important role in broadcasting information
to their communities. As a result, discovering such users’ social networks have become very
important, in particular, for marketing purposes. Various solutions already exist for identifying
influential users, most of which are structure-based, in that they investigate the influence of a user
according to his location in the network graph. This article proposes a novel approach for identifying
influential users on Instagram, by examining User Generated Contents (UGC). More specifically, the
proposed method combines various types of features extracted from the images posted on Instagram
to determine whether or not a user is influential, without requiring any information about the structure
of the network. An extensive set of experiments are performed to validate the effectiveness of the
proposed method in identifying influential users.
